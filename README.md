## üöÄ Installation Guide

Follow these steps to get Payroll Manager up and running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

*   Python 3.8+
*   pip (Python package installer)
*   MySQL or PostgreSQL database server

### Step-by-Step Installation

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/payroll-manager/payroll-manager.git
    cd payroll-manager
    ```

2.  **Create a Virtual Environment:**
    It's recommended to use a virtual environment to manage dependencies.
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3.  **Install Dependencies:**
    Install all required Python packages using pip.
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    *(Note: A `requirements.txt` file is assumed to be present in the project root.)*

4.  **Database Configuration:**
    *   Create a new database for the project (e.g., `payroll_db`).
    *   Open `payroll_manager/settings.py` (or equivalent) and configure your database settings.

    ```python
    # Example for PostgreSQL
    DATABASES = {
        'default': {
            'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.postgresql',
            'NAME': 'payroll_db',
            'USER': 'your_db_user',
            'PASSWORD': 'your_db_password',
            'HOST': 'localhost',
            'PORT': '5432',
        }
    }
    ```
    *(Adjust `ENGINE`, `NAME`, `USER`, `PASSWORD`, `HOST`, `PORT` as per your database setup.)*

5.  **Run Database Migrations:**
    Apply the database schema changes.
    ```bash
    python manage.py makemigrations
    python manage.py migrate
    ```

6.  **Create a Superuser (Optional but Recommended):**
    This allows you to access the administrative interface.
    ```bash
    python manage.py createsuperuser
    ```
    Follow the prompts to set up your username, email, and password.
